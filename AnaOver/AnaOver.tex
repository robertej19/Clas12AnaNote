For each kinematic bin the differential cross section can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma = \frac{N_{meas}}{L \epsilon}\frac{1}{\delta}
\end{equation}

Where $\frac{N_{meas}}{L}$ is the number of events from experiment normalized by the integrated luminosity before acceptance and radiatvie corrections. $\epsilon$ = $\frac{N^{RAD}_{rec}}{{N^{RAD}_{gen}}}$ is the acceptance correction and $\delta$ is the radiative correction.



$\delta$ can be obtained by using the following:

\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{N^{RAD}_{gen}}{N^{NORAD}_{gen}}
\end{equation}

luminosity = avogadros constant times the length of the target times teh density of the target (liquid hydrogen), times the ttoal collected charge in the farday cup, divided by the electron charge. 

\begin{equation}
    L = \frac{N_A l \rho Q_{FCUP}}{e}
\end{equation}
