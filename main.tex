\chapter{Personal To Do}


\section{Introduction}
Need to make plan!
Make tentative outline of how it will go to get a cross section
Define issues, etc
Push forward
Itâ€™s a question of the uncertainties 
What do we need to get cross sections by the end of the year using some subset of the data and some subset of the cross sections

Is it possible to show the same type graphs, but as a function of the t variable. Also, even more interesting would be, a two dimensional graphs  showing the distributions of events vs Q2 and t  for a given W, e.g. 3 GeV, for both the forward and central detectors.\\

Run through the 174 inbending runs\\

How does analysis change when using custom cuts instead of normal event builder cuts?\\


Make previous plots all broken up on fd and cd, and without using proton momentum\\

Make same plot on fd on cd \\
test across all 6 sectors\\
Show missing mass plots\\
Plot train info from pid\\

Plot based for pid says it's a proton at 5 gev, see that pod is still working there, cut shouldnt be too narrow, might have kinematic constraints\\

Compare with and without proton momentum - tag it, but dont use it to measure t and phi. Different systematics, so compare proton sytematics cd to pi systematics fd\\

Dear All,

I assembled a wikipage to document the minutes of our first and future meetings, this can be found under the "Minutes" tab. Additional tabs are designed to document each member's respective work under the category their work falls under. If I missed a member or if you did not submit your presentation please email me.

Dear Andrey,

Could you send us a link to the github for aao_rad and aao_norad with some instructions so that Bobby can follow up for his pi0 analysis?  

Dear Bobby,

aao_rad and aao_norad are event generators for exclusive pi0 and pi+ channels with/without radiative effects.  They are written in Fortran.  The program was initially developed by Volker Burkert long time ago for the resonance region, then has been evolved for many years and recently extended to DIS region even though lots of things need to be done.  Try this to see whether it works.  

Thanks.

Best regards, Kyungseon


Dear Stefan,

Could you upload the program (C++ version, perhaps in Githup with some instructions) that Kemal Tezgin recently wrote in order to calculate the pi0/pi+ channel observables based on the most recent GK model calculations?  Thanks.

Best regards, Kyungseon


Dear Kyungseon,

I have attached the program to calculate the single terms of the pi0 
cross-section based on the GK model.
Its only one file and relatively easy to use. The instructions are in 
the first few rows of the file.
The output can be modified in the main routine at the end of the file.

Best regards,
Stefan --- this file is name Pi_GK_Vegas.cpp


Main ToDo:

Hi Bobby,
Please take a look at README:
https://github.com/drewkenjo/aao_norad
It has instructions how to compile, run and configure the program.
Please don't hesitate to ask questions!
Best,
Andrey.
